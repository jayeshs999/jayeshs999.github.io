Hi there! I am Jayesh Singla. I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) department. Almost everything in computer science, with a specific liking for reinforcement learning and deep learning.

I am currently working on my *Bacheor's thesis* on efficient graph retrival techniques advised by [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) and [Prof. Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/). I am also involved with [Prof. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/)'s research group at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working on adverserial model learning paradigms. Moreover, for the past year, I have been working on a research project formulating new cryptographic definitions and primitives under the guidance of Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran. 

During the summer of 2022, I interned at [Optiver](https://optiver.com/) in Amsterdam as a software engineering intern with the Research & Data team. In the past, I have interned at [Octro Inc.](https://www.octro.com/) on a project involving creation on a Poker agent. I have also worked  with [Prof. Sándor P. Fekete](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/fekete/)'s group at [Technische Universität Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/) on unsolved problems in graph theory.

When I'm not busy with academics or work, I like to read, strum my guitar or play a sport 
(preferably soccer or table tennis). As a hobby, I love working on web development projects and was a Project Lead at [DevCom](https://in.linkedin.com/company/devcom-iit-bombay), the Developer's Community of IIT Bombay,  last year.

Always on the lookout for new opportunities in CS!
