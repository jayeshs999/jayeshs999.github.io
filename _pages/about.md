Hi there! I am Jayesh Singla. I am a senior undergraduate at IIT Bombay in the Computer Science and Engineering department. Almost everything in computer science, with a specific liking for reinforcement learning and  deep learning.

I am currently working on my *Bacheor's thesis* on efficient graph retrival techniques advised by Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti and Prof. Abir De. I am also involved with a research project on cryptographic definitions under the guidance of Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran. 

During the summer of 2022, I interned at Optiver, Amsterdam as a software engineering intern with the Research and Data team. In the past, I have interned at Octro Inc. on a project involving creation on a Poker agent. I have also worked  with Prof. Sandor P. Fekete's group at TU Braunschweig on unsolved problems in graph theory.

When I'm not busy with academics or work, I like to read, strum my guitar or play a sport 
(preferably soccer or table tennis). As a hobby, I love working on web development projects and was a Project Lead at Developer's Community at IIT Bombay last year.

Always on the lookout for new opportunities in CS!
